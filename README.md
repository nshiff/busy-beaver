Started with code from Professor Brailsford in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE8UhcyJS0I">Busy Beaver Turing Machines - Computerphile</a> video. Original code can be found at http://www.eprg.org/computerphile/busyb.htm or as busy-beaver.c in this repository.

To run, do as Prof. Brailsford did in the video (my main.c has a little correction so score prints correctly). (Windows instructions coming soon! If you can find gcc for Windows you are all set, or use Eclipse.)

    gcc main.c
    ./a.out|less

(the "|less" send the output to a program called "less", which lets you scroll through the output. Running as plain ./a.out is fine too.)
